# Spark-Practice

This repo is personal practice on Spark and API.
Data is fetched from Api and processed using spark.

End result is export file.


## Packages used
Spark
```bash
pip install pyspark
```
Request
```bash
pip install requests
```
Pandas
```bash
pip install pandas
```

## TO-DO List
1. Exception Handling - Check status of API call before trying to fetch data
2. Allow Selection of all story Categories
3. Performance Improvement - Measure time it takes to execute and try to improve
4. Add Operation Status - When adding data to the dataframe, status of the progress should be shown to the user.
Currently the terminal seems frozen.
5. Allow data to be saved. The program should prompt with available output formats
